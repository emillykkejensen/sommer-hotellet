/**
 * The stage takes the screen's shape.
 *
 * GAME_WIDTH × GAME_HEIGHT is the smallest stage, not the only one. A phone held sideways is
 * about twice as wide as it is tall, and a fixed 1.6 stage scaled to fit it left a band of
 * empty sky down both sides; a tablet is squarer, and lost the same band top and bottom. So
 * the stage keeps its height and grows wider on anything wider than 1.6, or keeps its width
 * and grows taller on anything squarer — every scene lays itself out from `scale.width` and
 * `scale.height`, so a wider stage is simply more room. Past the caps it letterboxes rather
 * than stretch a scene into a strip.

 * again. Everything a scene shows comes from GameState, so a restart loses nothing — except
 * an open task, whose answer would go with it, so a resize waits until the task is done.
